compile time , run time errors

compile time error occurs when we compile java code like this javac..
it mostly throws syntax errors

run time error occurs when we run the code java hello.java..
it throws errors like if we mismatched datatype..

how to compare two strings..

  -- how datas stored --

stack --> int a  = 10
heep --> object 
heep --> string pool --> string a = 10

        String s1 = new String("apple");
        String s2 = new String("apple");  
	--> the above creates new string object with new refrence address.
	    so when we compare like this s1 == s2 it throws false.
	    To get the right answer we've to use equals method like this (s1.equals(s2))

        String s3 = "orange"; 
        String s4 = "orange"; 
	--> this does creates new string, first it compares the string if there is similar in the string pool.
	    If there is, then it just use that refrence address so that memory won't be wasted.
	--> If we really want separate address for each String we've do this String  a = new String("one") this creates new string object.
	--> this just shares the reference address from equal or same string.

        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
        System.out.print(s3 == s4);
